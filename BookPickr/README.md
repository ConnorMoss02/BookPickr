## Why I Built This

I‚Äôve always loved discovering great books ‚Äî but every time I look at a massive list like the **New York Times Top 100** or a ‚ÄúBooks to Read Before You Die‚Äù compilation, I get stuck.  
How do you actually _choose_ which one to read next?

Scrolling through 100 titles feels overwhelming.  
So I figured‚Ä¶ why not make it simple?  
What if I just compare **two books at a time**?

That‚Äôs where **BookPickr** came in.  
It‚Äôs my new way to pick what to read ‚Äî one matchup at a time.  
Each round, two books go head-to-head. The winner stays; a new challenger appears.  
After a few rounds, the books with the most wins rise to the top.

At the end, it‚Äôs pretty clear which one I actually _want_ to read... usually.

- Choose a starting set of books:
- From the **New York Times Top 100**, or
- By **genre** or **author**, using live data from the **Open Library API**
- Play matchups between two books at a time ‚Äî ‚Äúwhich one would I rather read?‚Äù
- Track your top picks as the app builds your personalized leaderboard
- Reset and start over whenever you want a fresh set of matchups

## Inspiration

BookPickr was born out of curiosity and indecision.  
I love reading, but there's simply too many good books!

Now, the process feels like a _game_ ‚Äî and it helps me uncover what I‚Äôm genuinely excited to read next.
